The ECOSOC meets annually in July for a four-week session, and also holds special sessions as needed.At the Model United Nations (MUN), the ECOSOC Committee is a simulated version of the real ECOSOC, in which participants take on the role of delegates from different countries and work to address various economic and social issues facing the international community. In the ECOSOC Committee at MUN, delegates have the opportunity to discuss, debate, and negotiate solutions to pressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and sustainable development.One of the main functions of the ECOSOC Committee at MUN is to consider and adopt resolutions that address economic and social issues around the world. Delegates must work together to draft resolutions that reflect the positions of their respective countries and that are acceptable to a wide range of delegations. In addition to adopting resolutions, the ECOSOC Committee at MUN may also engage in discussions with guest speakers, such as experts in economics or development, in order to learn more about the challenges and opportunities facing the international community.</p>
