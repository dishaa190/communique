        <h2>DISARMAMENT AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE</h2>
        <p>DISEC (The United Nations Disarmament and International Security Committee) was created as the first of the Main Committees in the General Assembly when the charter of the United Nations was signed in 1945. The purpose of the committee in the General Assembly is to establish ‘general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments, and also to give “recommendations with regard to such principles to the Members or to the Security Council.”</p>
        <h2>Agenda</h2>
        <h4>"Revising the treaty on prohibition of nuclear weapons with special emphasis on the review committee."</h4>
        <h2>What and how?</h2>
        <p>The United Nations Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) is one of the six main committees of the United Nations General Assembly, and is responsible for promoting international peace and security through disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The DISEC is made up of all member states of the United Nations, and meets regularly throughout the year to discuss issues related to disarmament, arms control, and international security.At the Model United Nations (MUN), the DISEC Committee is a simulated version of the real DISEC, in which participants take on the role of delegates from different countries and work to address various issues related to disarmament and international security. In the DISEC Committee at MUN, delegates have the opportunity to discuss, debate, and negotiate solutions to pressing issues such as nuclear proliferation, arms trade, and regional conflicts. One of the main functions of the DISEC Committee at MUN is to consider and adopt resolutions that address disarmament and international security issues around the world. Delegates must work together to draft resolutions that reflect the positions of their respective countries and that are acceptable to a wide range of delegations. In addition to adopting resolutions, the DISEC Committee at MUN may also engage in discussions with guest speakers, such as experts in international relations or security, in order to learn more about the challenges and opportunities facing the international community.</p>
